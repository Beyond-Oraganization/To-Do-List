TO DO LIST

Simple example of Java project. Here you have example of basic database connection and simple Java classes.
You can easly add a graphic interface because all functions are separated between classes:
- Main class is responsible for showing messages in users console and collecting entry data
- TaskImportance is enumeration of possible task importance
- DatabaseController comunicates with database. It creates, deletes, modifies and reads the data from the database

In the future we're planning to:
- Secure connection with the databse
- Add graphical interface
- Add simple account system
- Add statistics for your tasks that was completed and not
